* Description
  "The spice must flow!"
  *curry* is a module that allows (almost) arbitrary python functions to be pickled and remotely executed.
  This module works with both *pickle* and *cPickle* python modules.

* Caveats
** Python versions
   Due to a dependence on the *marshal* module, the version of python
   that unpickles and executes the curried function needs to be the
   same as the version that pickled the function.
** Subclassing
   While _curry.curry_ looks like function application, it is really a
   constructor for a class implementing the __call__ method. Due to
   the way objects are pickled, subclassing *curry.curry* is prohibited.
** Recursive currying/partial application
   Do not try to curry an already curried object or a function
   obtained from applying *functools.partial*.
** Function default parameters
   In order to avoid problems do not directly specify default keyword
   arguments.
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   # this is bad, do not do this
   def foo(x, y, z=1): pass
   #+END_SRC
   Instead pop the defaults out of the /**kwargs/ dictionary:
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   # this is good, do this
   def foo(x, y, **kws):
       z = kws.pop('z', 1)
   #+END_SRC

* Installation
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ python setup.py install
  #+END_SRC

* Example
  #+BEGIN_SRC python
  import curry
  import pickle

  # define some function
  def foo(x, y, **kws)
      z = kws.pop('z', 1)
	  return x * y * z

  # "I wear a function now. Functions are cool"
  fn = curry.curry(foo, 3, z=9)

  with open('function.pkl', 'w') as fd:
      pickle.dump(fn, fd)

  with open('function.pkl') as fd:
      h = pickle.load(fd)

  # prints 162
  print h(6)
  #+END_SRC
